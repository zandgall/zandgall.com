                <h2 class="basictext">The Map Decoder was a small side project, to import and export .dat Minecraft maps and PNGs. It's main usage, is taking an image, and resizing and converting the colors to colors used by Minecraft maps. Then, it is written to NBT and can be used in any Minecraft world. There's not much to the program other than the code behind it, using a library to write the NBT, and filtering colors based on which color is closest in "distance". Where, RGB would be XYZ and it checks differences between "Points"</h2>
