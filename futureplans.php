    <h1 class="basictext">I plan on porting any projects I want to keep working on, over to C++. I've been learning it through a solar system simulation for my Tech class.<br><br>This is where Arvopia will go, and I plan on porting Schute! as well. Games and programs will continue to be made, over in that environment.<br><br>I have no idea for sure when I will start all that, but as of writing this, (4/26/20) I would guess that it'd be early summer.</h1>
