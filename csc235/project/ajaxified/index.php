    <h1>What to look at</h1>
    <p>For the assignment, relevant code is in pagelet.php (not-viewable from browser) and <a href="readMe">readMe</a>.</p>
    <p>Currently, going to <a href="home">home</a> will take you to a further prototype of the final version. Not all content is final, and some functionality is shakey.</p>
    <p>jumbled.html and outline.html are simply references for me to help figure out where different pieces of the website will go in order to design the puzzle aspect of the website.</p>
