6 - 98 - <p>this makes a bit of a challenge in some way, if you want to keep worms year round, it's best to keep them in the actual ground like in a garden. but if u don't want them getting lost and never seeing them again, a worm bin can help, but it is much more difficult to ensure their warmth and health year round</p>
7 - 99 - <p>worm bins r good for making compost n things, and is a good alternative to keeping worms directly in ur garden!</p>
8 - 00 - <p>another way to keep worms in one solid container is with a terrarium, this is a good option if u just wanna take care of one or a few worms. it requires more direct care, but it's a good opportunity to give them a little plant and even some <strong>accessories</strong>!!</p>

6 - 06 - <p>i kno that peopple think that worms are gross. i know that some of the worms i talked about are scary.</p>
7 - 07 - <p>and thats okay, i understand feelin that way. buti hope u can appreciate worms a little more. and that these little creatures, whether they're helpful little earthworms, or scary parasites</p>
