Instead of hallways which extended out of the box to exterior rooms like TheOwen05's base, Evan's base was mostly contained and filled with walkways suspended within the box, most walkways were useless and didn't connect to any rooms. The base had two rooms which extended out from the box, one room being \"The Garden of Evan\", and one room being a white tower room. Both rooms would eventually inspire future projects related to ROSS; {s,The Garden of Evan,The Garden of Evan}, and Evan's Illegal Tower, the latter of which got Evan's server operator status removed.",

Started on the evening of November 6th, the design for the tower was inspired by a room that extended out from Evan's base, which became a model for how the tower would look in aesthetic and design. Being built largely in the evening of November 6th into the morning of the 7th, the project was undertaken by Evan and Isaac in creative mode. The project consisted of a building on the land just outside the tower which connected to the tower, the tower itself, and a raised platform made of melons, glass, sea pickles, and fences, which sat outside the tower. During the beginning of the build, Miles and TheOwen05 also joined in the process of building the tower, but only for the first two floors. The tower was 11 stories tall, 10 of the floors were a repeated circular design with later additions like external rooms or interior decoration, and the 11th floor was a large domed room (with a higher and lower level, aquarium ceiling, and minibar) which had a larger floor area than the floors below it. On November 8th, the towers floor plan had been completed, and Evan anounced he intended to allow ROSS server members to reserve a floor on the tower which they could customize. This prompted question from zandgall and TheGreyWolf, who were concerned about the obvious cheating so close to spawn. Another issue with the build was server lag; Isaac, Evan, and Miles had covered the melon platform outside the tower with Polar Bears and Dolphins, and zander had to kill a few hundred entities from the chunks around the platform. After the controversy, the project was largely abandoned (however largely completed as well), and Evan was removed of his server Operator permissions, ending his run of command cheating on ROSS 2.0. On December 14th, it was discovered someone had filled a large amount of the negative space in the Tower with Planks, Evan suspects to this day it was TheGreyWolf.",

The shop was also an incredibly ugly build, it was built using a junk shulker of unused leftover stones like granite, diorite, and andesite, and had a two-block tall ceiling. When the shop was first opened, Zander and Isaac joined Evan in the building of the shop and started turning the shop into a pillar tower using all of the blocks from their junk shulkers and chests, creating a comically ugly tower which was close to reaching build height. This tower became another Evan-related controversy, as TheGreyWolf demanded the shop be removed. Ultimately, zander upon completing the tower had the world reset to just as we were starting the tower, but allowed the shop to stay.

Zander created the resource pack, and it was made first by taking a resource pack which ripped some of the assets from the Festive Mash-Up Bedrock texture pack, then adding many custom textures and sounds to it, eventually becoming it's own server-exclusive pack, the ROSS ChristmasPack. Evan did most all of the builds in the Christmas Area, although Zander helped out with a large part of the Rollercoaster. A few days after the project had started, Zander gave Evan server operator permissions to work on the area, a decision which had many ramifications later in the server history.",

While the business of trading heads never went anywhere on the server, people did begin to somewhat develop an endowment effect ot the player heads they had already collected, and so the value of displaying your own heads did begin to become popular. This shop inspired the Second Head Trading Hall, which was built later in ROSS 3.0 by Evan.",

On December 29th, three members (HappyHamster65, QeorgeW, markiplierfan) from the Wanker Crew discord server joined ROSS 2.0 for the first time. Evan and Miles joined them in touring spawn, but ultimately the five of them decided to run off and look for a place to set up a base together. They settled on the jungle which from spawn laid just past the desert with the combat arena and boat racetrack. In this jungle, the five of them quickly devoted themselves to something of a gameplay reset where they tried to start the game mostly from scratch in their jungle setup. It became a joke between the 5 of them that they were primitivists, they all created caveman skins and called their jungle setup Ooga Booga Land. Once they got a working Nether Portal, they proceeded to due multiple \"expeditions\", these trips where they would go to the nether tunnels, and crouch-sneak around the ROSS 2.0 smp area. Once they were seen by any given server member, they would run away and retreat back to Ooga Booga Land. On one expedition, they went to the base of Grey and Zandgall, where there was a running joke that QeorgeW had fallen in love with Grey. Ultimately, Zander and Isaac wound up visiting Ooga Booga land, and the server somewhat returned to normalcy. By then, it was late in the day, and the five had been playing for many hours, however this smp experience inspired these members to start a fresh new smp with Wanker Crew members and others. The next day, Zandgall joined Wanker crew to be able to talk with the Wanker Members, he remains as a member of the discord to this day. Evan was able to open a new smp Realm as \"The Garden of Evan\" on December 31st, 2020. After this, the ROSS 2.0 world was largely unplayed, and the Realm was used for things like Skyblock and minigames, until eventually zander stopped renewing his realms subscription.",

In the ocean is a small hidden room with two flames kept in them{i,9}. Behind the house is an room filled with signs, with a nether portal{i,10}. South of the island, there is a small chicken-egg farm, in front of another wool creature{i,11}. Further south exists a cow farm, wheat and pumpkin farms, a horse stable, gravestones for dead pets, and a small sand house with nothing inside{i,12}. In the desert there are more points of interest. Such as the \"UWU\" spelling cacti{i,13}, the firehouse to the east{i,14}{i,15}, and a few more hidden underground locations. These include, another empty underground hideout in the ocean{i,16}, and underground jail-cell underneath the pumpkin patch{i,17}, and a hidden temple-looking underground series of staircases, containing signs pertaining to the relationship of the time{i,18}{i,19}.",

Many innocents were locked up in a fit of paranoia, the items weren't being found. Until one day zandgall 'mysteriously' found them in an abandoned ship wreck near spawn. DubTron rightfully questioned zandgall about this, which sent them into a fit of rage, bursting out at DubTron for daring to question his authority and loyalty. Such a rage had never been seen on Ross, and wouldn't be seen again until {s,Ross 2,Ross 2.} It is hard to overstate how drastic the situation was, zandgall began a rampage of interrogations, trying to find who 'might have taken these items.' But it was a lost cause, and somewhere in their cracked psyche, they knew that. Things escalated as members started to refuse interrogation requests, citing stupid reasons like \"the items have already been found,\" \"you already interrogated me,\" \"i think this is going too far.\" the person who stole the items was still out there, and they had to find them. as the situation escalated, and the thief refused to reveal themself, zandgall began to take more drastic measures that he thought would only be last resorts. he began to travel out to see the other ross members in person, one occurrence even requiring a plane flight,. but i had to do everything i could to seek justice. strangely all the participants started to fight back and claimed i was taking things too far. i had a feeling at that point that everyone else was in on it. they had all taken the items, and were hiding it from me. they were conspiring with eachother to make sure the truth never came out, no matter hwo hard i hit them. but there are uncomfortable things we must do for justice, and i dont take stolen items lightly. finally, one of them confessed. i immediately knew they were being thrown under the bus by the others, and i scoured the room to find them, i know they were there watching me, but i could never find them. to this day no one else has admitted to taking part in the theft of these valuable items. but justice has to wait, things get ugly real quickb when these scheming criminals know what i am doing. i must first isolate myself so that they can't see me coming. justice will come one day.",

Around the base there are several farms, like a cobblestone farm{i,3}{i,4}, a super smelter (which automatically smelts some cobble from the cobble farm into stone){i,5}, a wool farm which gathers wool of all colors{i,6}{i,7}, a concrete farm in which the player simply places powdered concrete on a designated block, from which it will be wet into concrete blocks, and blown up and collected{i,8}. A basic makeshift iron farm was in progress{i,9}, and two renditions of a slime farm, one that was just a simple wide open underground area{i,10}, and another that was intended to be more of a fully automated slime farm{i,11}. And finally, from what last documentation exists, a villager breeder{i,12}. These villagers were likely used in {b,43,Zandgall's Village} to the southwest.",
