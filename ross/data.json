Started on the evening of November 6th, the design for the tower was inspired by a room that extended out from Evan's base, which became a model for how the tower would look in aesthetic and design. Being built largely in the evening of November 6th into the morning of the 7th, the project was undertaken by Evan and Isaac in creative mode. The project consisted of a building on the land just outside the tower which connected to the tower, the tower itself, and a raised platform made of melons, glass, sea pickles, and fences, which sat outside the tower. During the beginning of the build, Miles and TheOwen05 also joined in the process of building the tower, but only for the first two floors. The tower was 11 stories tall, 10 of the floors were a repeated circular design with later additions like external rooms or interior decoration, and the 11th floor was a large domed room (with a higher and lower level, aquarium ceiling, and minibar) which had a larger floor area than the floors below it. On November 8th, the towers floor plan had been completed, and Evan anounced he intended to allow ROSS server members to reserve a floor on the tower which they could customize. This prompted question from zandgall and TheGreyWolf, who were concerned about the obvious cheating so close to spawn. Another issue with the build was server lag; Isaac, Evan, and Miles had covered the melon platform outside the tower with Polar Bears and Dolphins, and zander had to kill a few hundred entities from the chunks around the platform. After the controversy, the project was largely abandoned (however largely completed as well), and Evan was removed of his server Operator permissions, ending his run of command cheating on ROSS 2.0. On December 14th, it was discovered someone had filled a large amount of the negative space in the Tower with Planks, Evan suspects to this day it was TheGreyWolf.","server":"Ross 2","type":"Build","builders":["I_C_Evan","BaconWaffle3213"],"coordinates":["575","63","-520"],"constructed":"2020-11-08","thumbnail":"Ross 2\/Build\/Evans_Illegal_Tower_(Ross_2)\/thumbnail.png","images":[{"src":"Ross 2\/Build\/Evans_Illegal_Tower_(Ross_2)\/2023-06-04_06.52.17.png","caption":"The melon pickle bowl."},{"src":"Ross 2\/Build\/Evans_Illegal_Tower_(Ross_2)\/2023-06-04_06.52.32.png","caption":"A level with a bar."},{"src":"Ross 2\/Build\/Evans_Illegal_Tower_(Ross_2)\/2023-06-04_06.52.38.png","caption":"A level with a kitchen and seating, owned by {p,mil_es,mil_es.}"},{"src":"Ross 2\/Build\/Evans_Illegal_Tower_(Ross_2)\/2023-06-04_06.52.45.png","caption":"Level with an exit, owned by {p,BaconWaffle3213,Isaac.}"},{"src":"Ross 2\/Build\/Evans_Illegal_Tower_(Ross_2)\/2023-06-04_06.52.47.png","caption":"A level with .. an ent chrystal ...*shudders*"},{"src":"Ross 2\/Build\/Evans_Illegal_Tower_(Ross_2)\/2023-06-04_06.52.49.png","caption":"The top level with a walkway to an overlook behind the camera in this image, and a stair to an upper area."},{"src":"Ross 2\/Build\/Evans_Illegal_Tower_(Ross_2)\/2023-06-04_06.52.57.png","caption":"The upper level, with a staircase continuing up to a bar."},{"src":"Ross 2\/Build\/Evans_Illegal_Tower_(Ross_2)\/2023-06-04_06.53.00.png","caption":"The highest point of the tower, with fish in the ceiling and a bar."},{"src":"Ross 2\/Build\/Evans_Illegal_Tower_(Ross_2)\/2023-06-04_06.53.07.png","caption":"The walkway to the overlook."},{"src":"Ross 2\/Build\/Evans_Illegal_Tower_(Ross_2)\/2023-06-04_06.53.18.png","caption":"The overlook, with a big hole in the center."},{"src":"Ross 2\/Build\/Evans_Illegal_Tower_(Ross_2)\/2023-06-04_06.53.29.png","caption":"A walkway to the main entrance."},{"src":"Ross 2\/Build\/Evans_Illegal_Tower_(Ross_2)\/2023-06-04_06.53.34.png","caption":"The main entrance."}],"events":[""],"page":"Evans_Illegal_Tower_(Ross_2)","on_map":true},{"name":"The Tavern","description":"The Tavern was a build by Evan on ROSS 2.0, Started on September 1st and finished on September 2nd.

Evan and Miles joined them in touring spawn, but ultimately the five of them decided to run off and look for a place to set up a base together. They settled on the jungle which from spawn laid just past the desert with the combat arena and boat racetrack. In this jungle, the five of them quickly devoted themselves to something of a gameplay reset where they tried to start the game mostly from scratch in their jungle setup. It became a joke between the 5 of them that they were primitivists, they all created caveman skins and called their jungle setup Ooga Booga Land. Once they got a working Nether Portal, they proceeded to due multiple \"expeditions\", these trips where they would go to the nether tunnels, and crouch-sneak around the ROSS 2.0 smp area. Once they were seen by any given server member, they would run away and retreat back to Ooga Booga Land. On one expedition, they went to the base of Grey and Zandgall, where there was a running joke that QEorgeW had fallen in love with Grey. Ultimately, Zander and Isaac wound up visiting Ooga Booga land, and the server somewhat returned to normalcy. By then, it was late in the day, and the five had been playing for many hours, however this smp experience inspired these members to start a fresh new smp with Wanker Crew members and others. The next day, Zandgall joined Wanker crew to be able to talk with the Wanker Members, he remains as a member of the discord to this day. Evan was able to open a new smp Realm as \"The Garden of Evan\" on December 31st, 2020.

They went with an interesting design at first, with a hole near the center of the island, where endermen would chase an endermite from a sectioned out dry portion of the land, into a hole, where they can be 1 shot{i,2}. This design, however, proved too finicky and difficult to get working, and so opted to build a big tower that proved easier to build, and more efficient{i,3}. The original farm was kept as an area to use enchanting tables and anvils{i,4}{i,5}.","server":"Ross 1","type":"Build","builders":["zandgall","Grey_Phantom777"],"coordinates":["0","0","0"],"constructed":"2019-06-09","thumbnail":"Ross 1\/Build\/The_End_(Ross_1)\/thumbnail.png","images":[{"src":"Ross 1\/Build\/The_End_(Ross_1)\/2019-06-09_21.09.10.png","caption":"The end in the process of being coated in water."},{"src":"Ross 1\/Build\/The_End_(Ross_1)\/2019-06-09_11.00.45.png","caption":"Result of end pillaging."},{"src":"Ross 1\/Build\/The_End_(Ross_1)\/2019-06-14_15.10.40.png","caption":"The only remaining evidence of the original enderman farm design."},{"src":"Ross 1\/Build\/The_End_(Ross_1)\/2020-01-08_19.58.17.png","caption":"The current design of the enderman farm."},{"src":"Ross 1\/Build\/The_End_(Ross_1)\/2020-01-08_19.58.26.png","caption":"What became of the old farm."},{"src":"Ross 1\/Build\/The_End_(Ross_1)\/2020-01-08_19.58.37.png","caption":"The underground area of the old farm, now an enchanting area."},{"src":"Ross 1\/Build\/The_End_(Ross_1)\/2019-09-07_17.45.28.png","caption":"A pile up of endermen."},{"src":"Ross 1\/Build\/The_End_(Ross_1)\/2019-09-07_17.45.38.png","caption":"Gathering of XP through the use of the enderman farm."}],"events":[""],"page":"The_End_(Ross_1)","on_map":false},{"name":"Spawn (Ross 1)","description":"Spawn has been a running feature of Ross servers.

Many innocents were locked up in a fit of paranoia, the items weren't being found. Until one day zandgall 'mysteriously' found them in an abandoned ship wreck near spawn.

Such a rage had never been seen on Ross, and wouldn't be seen again until {s,Ross 2,Ross 2.} It is hard to overstate how drastic the situation was, zandgall began a rampage of interrogations, trying to find who 'might have taken these items.' But it was a lost cause, and somewhere in their cracked psyche, they knew that. Things escalated as members started to refuse interrogation requests, citing stupid reasons like \"the items have already been found,\" \"you already interrogated me,\" \"i think this is going too far.\" the person who stole the items was still out there, and they had to find them. as the situation escalated, and the thief refused to reveal themself, zandgall began to take more drastic measures that he thought would only be last resorts. he began to travel out to see the other ross members in person, one occurrence even requiring a plane flight,. but i had to do everything i could to seek justice. strangely all the participants started to fight back and claimed i was taking things too far. i had a feeling at that point that everyone else was in on it. they had all taken the items, and were hiding it from me. they were conspiring with eachother to make sure the truth never came out, no matter hwo hard i hit them. but there are uncomfortable things we must do for justice, and i dont take stolen items lightly. finally, one of them confessed. i immediately knew they were being thrown under the bus by the others, and i scoured the room to find them, i know they were there watching me, but i could never find them. to this day no one else has admitted to taking part in the theft of these valuable items. but justice has to wait, things get ugly real quickb when these scheming criminals know what i am doing. i must first isolate myself so that they can't see me coming. justice will come one day.","server":"Ross
