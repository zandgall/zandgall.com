                Sometime in November of 2017. I was way down deep into the rabbit hole that is Java. At the time, I was looking for a way to draw things to the screen! No one had taught me, and googling "draw things to screeen java" wasn't helping either. I stumbled apon a series then, named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLah6faXAgguMnTBs3JnEJY0shAc18XYQZ" target="_blank">Beginner 2D Game Programming</a>. Not the best name I'll admit, but it got me hooked, and I started following it.

            <h4 class="basictext" style="animation: fb 2s 1.3s 1 forwards">
                I drew up a little character and put him in my little game I was following along with. But there was a big difference between the tutorial I was following, and the game I was making. The tutorial was for tile games, whereas I had made a platformer.
            </h4>
            <h4 class="basictext" style="animation: fb 2s 1.3s 1 forwards">
                I believe I had followed the tutorial until Episode 29, then I broke out and just continued on my own. I had some independance however since I started more to skim through episodes by around Episode 20, and didn't fully watch nor thoroughly watched them.

                Then came the first release, the main reason a release happened is that I wanted to be able to play the game outside of Eclipse (the IDE that I use). So I found a way to output it. Another reason why, is that I would put it as a download, in my game log series. If you're wondering what happened to the game log series, I took it down and will probably put it back up sometime in the near future.

                Because I liked it so much, I decided to continue on with it and fix some bug in the previous version. The main bugs were a wall-jumping bug, and a normal jumping bug. <br>
                The wall jumping bug would occur right when you jump into a wall. This caused you to fly high up. The other jumping bug made it so you wouldn't always jump a normal hieght. Sometimes you would just jump a few pixels off the ground. The normal jumping bug wasn't fixed until version 0.4.

            <h4 class="basictext" style="animation: fb 2s 1.3s 1 forwards">
                Version 0.2 was something, I felt like a real developer making his project. This felt like a huge step for me, and since I'm definitely not that good with keeping projects going, this was great news.
            </h4>
            
            <h4 class="basictext" style="animation: fb 2s 1.3s 1 forwards">
                I kept on making and making to get this released, and it felt like a huge deal to already be able to add new entities like the snap of my fingers. I think this was very important and we wouldn't have the same game today if I did 0.2 differently.
            </h4>

            <h4 class="basictext" style="animation: fb 2s 1.3s 1 forwards">
                Apart from the making, and how it helped me, there wasn't any major features that got released in this version. Like the <a href="arvopiadownload.html">downloads page</a> says, this only added things that were foundations. Like the foxes, foxes themselves weren't a big deal, but since I know how to and I can add more entities, it laid a path down that still has lots of potenial. There was also the addition of entity destruction which paved a way for combat and resources.

            <img id="V0.3" class="section" style="margin-left: -5%; margin-right: auto; width: 110%; position: relative"  src="Sources/Arvopia0.3Showoff.png" alt="Version 0.3">

            <h4 class="basictext" style="animation: fb 2s 1.3s 1 forwards">
                I feel like Version 0.3 was misnamed. By "Game Quality" I meant that it had removed almost all lag, and gave you some freedom to explore the world. Overall, 0.3 wasn't great and definitely wasn't perfect. This was more of a filler update to get rid of lag and some bugs.
            </h4>
            
            <h4 class="basictext" style="animation: fb 2s 1.3s 1 forwards">
                However what it did add was pretty great. It added a menu state, with control over the FPS. It also added a respawn mechanic. The main features however was the badly done 'combat'. Simply a click-to-kill combat system with health, as well as a GUI for your inventory. Simply put this update wasn't the best, but it did extend the paths for the future.

            <img id="V0.4" class="section" style="margin-left: -5%; margin-right: auto; width: 110%; position: relative"  src="Sources/Arvopia0.4Showoff.png" alt="Version 0.4">
            
            <h3 class="basictext" style="animation: fb 2s 1.1s 1 forwards">
                Version 0.4
            </h3>
            
            <h4 class="basictext" style="animation: fb 2s 1.3s 1 forwards">
                Version 0.4 was probably the biggest graphical update so far. It was a very fun update to work on, and an amazing update to release. The amount of content produced in LESS THAN A MONTH, is crazy.
            </h4>
            <h4 class="basictext" style="animation: fb 2s 1.3s 1 forwards">
                This version added an enviornment which includes lights, wind, and weather! This version also added the main menu that has been used. Another big feature of this update is the original soundtrack. Overall, I think the name is well fit as the Light update, because it is probably the biggest addition. 
            </h4>
            <h4 class="basictext" style="animation: fb 2s 1.3s 1 forwards">
                This version also created a tools system as well as expanded upon the current items and particles system. This version, while being a great and one of the best updates, was a perfect segway to 0.5.
            </h4>
            
            <img id="V0.5" class="section" style="margin-left: -5%; margin-right: auto; width: 110%; position: relative"  src="Sources/Arvopia0.5Showoff.png" alt="Version 0.5">
            
            <h3 class="basictext" style="animation: fb 2s 1.1s 1 forwards">

            </h3>
            
            <h4 class="basictext" style="animation: fb 2s 1.3s 1 forwards">
                Version 0.5 known as the Foilage Update, was well named. Introducing a wild variety of additions to the Enviornments, mainly to the plants. This version was especially fun to work with, and the full potention in the update hasn't even been released yet! (It's in 0.6).
            </h4>
            
            <h4 class="basictext" style="animation: fb 2s 1.3s 1 forwards">
                One of the main features apart from the trees, the grass, and the ferns and dandilions, was the new improvement on particles and entities having a better health bar. 
            </h4>
            <h4 class="basictext" style="animation: fb 2s 1.3s 1 forwards">
                Another main feature would be the added Crafting GUI. This GUI, while looking and working absolute trash, is one step towards self made materials. I can assure you that this will be important beyond and even in 0.8+ maybe.
            </h4>
            
            <img id="V0.6" class="section" style="margin-left: -5%; margin-right: auto; width: 110%; position: relative"  src="Sources/Arvopia0.6Showoff.png" alt="Version 0.6">

            </h3>
            
            <h4 class="basictext" style="animation: fb 2s 1.1s 1 forwards">
                Version 0.6 added more than what could've been added in a month, that's why this update took 6 months to complete fully. With the wait though, there sure is some new elements to play with!
            </h4>
            <h4 class="basictext" style="animation: fb 2s 1.1s 1 forwards">
                The main feature of 0.6, was the addition of NPCs, along with Quests, and Achievements. With the NPCs though, there was an addition of a more area-aware ai and some houses as decoration to go with the NPCs.
            </h4>
            
            <h4 class="basictext" style="animation: fb 2s 1.1s 1 forwards">
                In the first world that has always been showcased you'll see the addition of a village to the right of what has already been discovered. In that village there are two Quest NPCs, along with an automatically generated NPC "Lia" who will tell you how the game works and greet you everytime you open the world.
            </h4>
            
            <h4 class="basictext" style="animation: fb 2s 1.1s 1 forwards">
                Along with changes to the first world, there was a new "World 4" added, and you'll see that in the 0.6-new world loader state.
            </h4>
            <h4 class="basictext" style="animation: fb 2s 1.1s 1 forwards">
                There are a lot more changes, but for further changes, consult the changelog or download the game and find out for yourself.
            </h4>
            
            <img id="V0.7" class="section" style="margin-left: -5%; width: 110%; height:auto; position: relative" src="assets/0.7Screenshot%201.png" alt="Version 0.7">

            <h4 class="basictext" style="animation: fb 2s 1.1s 1 forwards">
                Arvopia 0.7 was updated with a heavy focus on modding support, and to be able to change anything about the game. Story lines and quests are supported, though not used quite yet. Creating NPC's is a possibility though.

            <h4 class = "basictext" style="animation: fb 2s 1.1s 1 forwards">
                But this update adds more than just modification support, it also adds player customization, new GUIs, better trading system, fully functional inventory, a full audio system refix ith a new song, as well as many redesigns.
            </h4>
            <h4 class = "basictext" style="animation: fb 2s 1.1s 1 forwards">
                This was an absolutely wonderful update to work on, it doesn't seem to add too much, but it's worth getting.
