    <h2 class="basictext outlinetext">The better, of the ScoreSpace Game Jam games</h2>

    <h2 class="basictext">
        This game, Schute!, was also made for the ScoreSpace Game Jam similar to Falling Mine. However, the big difference, is that this one had more potential. It's a fun experience playing this game, and it look pretty good for a Game Jam game made by me.<br><br>
        It works so good in fact, that I will remake it in C++ with better controls and physics and overall level designs. I'm not sure when this will happen, especially with a ScoreSpace Game Jam coming up as I'm writing this, that I might join.<br><br>
        Overall this game is worth playing, and hopefully will be remade perfectly.
