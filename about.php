        <h1 class="basictext outlinetext" style="font-size: 44">General</h1>
        <h1 class="basictext">Who are you?</h1>
        <h3 class="basictext">I'm Zander Gall, a 15yo programmer that works on a few projects like Arvopia.</h3>
        <h1 class="basictext">What do you do?</h1>
        <h3 class="basictext">
            Like I said above, I spend my time programming, but I also make <a href="music">music</a> and I play
            Minecraft with a bunch of friends.
        </h3>
        <h1 class="basictext">How do you do that?</h1>
        <h3 class="basictext">
            I program using tools like <a href="eclipse.org">Eclipse (Java)</a>, <a
                href="visualstudio.microsoft.com">Visual Studio (C++)</a>, and <a href="code.visualstudio.com">Visual
                Studio Code (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)</a>. For making music I use, <a
                href="https://www.image-line.com/flstudio/">FL Studio</a>.
        </h3>
        <h1 class="basictext">Why do you do that?</h1>
        <h3 class="basictext">
            I started on Khanacademy when I was homeschooled. I had found their Coding lessons and I got hooked and made
            a few projects over <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/zandgall/projects">there</a>. I had also
            used scratch to make a few <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Zandgall/">projects</a> before I moved on
            to Java

        <!-- Arvopia -->
        <h1 class="basictext outlinetext" style="font-size: 44">Arvopia</h1>
        <h1 class="basictext">What's Arvopia?</h1>
        <h3 class="basictext">
            Arvopia is my biggest project, I started it back in November of 2017 when I switched over to Java. You can
            find the full history, and more information <a href="arvopia">here</a>
        </h3>
        <h1 class="basictext">When is it going to continue?</h1>
        <h3 class="basictext">
            Right now, I'm working on learning C++ and I plan on porting that, and a few other favored projects, to
            there.
        </h3>
        <!-- Project managing -->
        <h1 class="basictext outlinetext" style="font-size: 44">Other projects</h1>
        <h1 class="basictext">What else do you work on?</h1>
        <h3 class="basictext">
            As I said previously, I'm learning C++. At the time of writing this I am making a solar system simulation
            for my HS tech class. It has helped me learn alot about C++ and OpenGL, so I plan on beginning my first
            ported game in May 2020 (if things go well).<br>
            I make plenty of games and fun little programs. You can look at some of the bigger ones from the <a
                href="index">homepage</a>, and check out some of the more littler "funsies" <a href="funstuff">here</a>
        </h3>
        <h1 class="basictext">Which is the best?</h1>
        <h3 class="basictext">
            Out of all the games I've made, Arvopia and Schute! are my two favorites. Arvopia being the biggest one, and
            although Schute is a bite-sized game right now (until the port someday), both are quite fun to play around
            with. You can check out those from the <a href="index.php">homepage</a>
        </h3>
        <h1 class="basictext">Which is the worst?</h1>
        <h3 class="basictext">
            Between Super Marbo and Bubble Cannons. Although both were quite fun to make, and even a little fun to play,
            Super Marbo is my buggiest game and Bubble Cannons is the most boring.
