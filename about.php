    <h3 class="basictext">I'm Zander Gall, a young-yet-aging tech nerd who's focused on programming. I have a whole host of projects that anyone can take a look at.</h3>
    <h1 class="basictext">What do you do?</h1>
    <h3 class="basictext">
        Like I said above, I spend my time programming, but I also make <a href="music">music</a>.
    </h3>
    <h1 class="basictext">How do you do that?</h1>
    <h3 class="basictext">
        I program using tools like <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA (Java)</a>, <a
            href="visualstudio.microsoft.com">Visual Studio (C++)</a>, and <a href="code.visualstudio.com">Visual
            Studio Code (PHP/HTML/CSS/JavaScript)</a>. For making music I use, <a
            href="https://www.image-line.com/flstudio/">FL Studio</a>.
    </h3>
    <h1 class="basictext">Why do you do that?</h1>
    <h3 class="basictext">
        I started on Khanacademy when I was homeschooled. I had found their Coding lessons and I got hooked and made
        a few projects over <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/zandgall/projects">there</a>. I had also
        used Scratch to make a few <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Zandgall/">projects</a> before I moved on
        to Java where I began to learn serious code. At first, obviously I wasn't very good, but I still wanted to
        make something big. So I started work on a little game called "Arvopia."
    </h3>
    <!-- Arvopia -->
    <h1 class="basictext outlinetext" style="font-size: 44">Arvopia</h1>
    <h1 class="basictext">What's Arvopia?</h1>
    <h3 class="basictext">
        Arvopia was my first big project way back in November 2017. It was a little sandbox-esque game, with some
        survival and RPG elements. It didn't get very far content wise,
        but it taught me a lot about Java, coding in general, and the game making process. If you would like to see
        the full history and more information,
        you can read more on it <a href="arvopia">here.</a>
    </h3>
    <h1 class="basictext">When is it going to continue?</h1>
    <h3 class="basictext">
        Arvopia was developed through a series of updates, but for the time being it is on pause while I focus on my
        main education, and develop my skills as a programmer
        before I consider picking it up again. If I do pick it up, Arvopia will almost certainly be reworked in C++,
        a huge change to make, but it would be best to
        completely rewrite it from scratch anyways.

    <!-- Project managing -->
    <h1 class="basictext outlinetext" style="font-size: 44">Other projects</h1>
    <h1 class="basictext">What else do you work on?</h1>
    <h3 class="basictext">
        I have a whole host of projects available to look at from my <a href="index">homepage</a> as well as by looking through the list of projects and resources you can find in the menu that you can open at the top-right corner.
        I make games, little tools and programs. I also have a few online JavaScript things you can check out on my <a href="funstuff">'funsies page'</a>
    </h3>
    <h1 class="basictext">Which is your best project?</h1>
    <h3 class="basictext">
        I'm working on a lot of projects every once in a while, and I'm proud of most of them. But out of all the projects I've posted on this website, I'd say that 
        Arvopia and Schute! are the two most worth checking out. And although it isn't really a published game or even tool, my recent <a href="qb64 3d">interactive paper on 3D rendering
        in BASIC</a> is definitely one of my best pieces of work.
    </h3>
    <h1 class="basictext">Which is the worst?</h1>
    <h3 class="basictext">
        Although it's a harsh title to give, I do has some projects, tools, and games that haven't gotten the work they deserved. For one, 'Super Marbo'. A mock
        PC remake of Super Mario Bros. for the NES. It's fully functional and has some neat features like the ability to use New Super Mario Bros-styled sprites and moveset.
        However it left much to be desired. It was buggy, clunky, and didn't really live up to my own expectations. Beyond that, there are some projects like some 'misc Arvopia tools',
        as I call them, that aren't really worth playing around with. They were intended to evolve to become sort of a modding toolset, but as Arvopia was dropped they don't really serve a purpose.
